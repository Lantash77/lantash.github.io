    <title lang="en">Kenny</title>
  <desc lang="en">Documentary. The unique story of a man whose life and career have become entwined with the fortunes of his adopted city of Liverpool. Known as 'The King', Kenny Dalglish was revered by fans during his time at Liverpool FC, where as a player and manager he won 27 major trophies. However, arguably his greatest challenge came in the aftermath of the Hillsborough stadium tragedy, when he became a beacon of hope and strength in the fight for justice that followed. Uplifting, powerful, funny but at times truly heartbreaking, Kenny is a portrait of a proud Scotsman who captured the hearts of everyone on Merseyside.</desc>
