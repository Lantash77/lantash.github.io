Despite her lack of experience, Eleanor is drawn deeper into the case as she, and her newfound mentor, realise that she may be the only person, given her own tortured psyche, who can understand the mind of this singular killer.

Despite her lack of experience, Eleanor is drawn deeper into the case as she, and her newfound mentor, realise that she may be the only person, given her own tortured psyche, who can understand the mind of this singular killer.
