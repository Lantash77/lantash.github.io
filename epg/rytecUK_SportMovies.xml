  <desc lang="en">Liverpool v Chelsea (Kick-off 8.15pm). Coverage of the top-flight match from Anfield, as the hosts look to continue their excellent run of form. Jurgen Klopp's side are unbeaten at home in the league and are looking for their first top-flight title since 2020. The Reds are unbeaten in seven matches against today's opponents, but strangely they haven't actually beaten the Blues inside 90 minutes in those meetings.</desc>

Coverage of the top-flight match from Molineux, as the home side look to exact revenge on their opening-day loss in the reverse fixture. Gary O'Neil's team were denied what looked like a stonewall last-minute penalty in their 1-0 defeat at Old Trafford, as Raphael Varane scored a 76th-minute winner to give the Red Devils all three points.</desc>
