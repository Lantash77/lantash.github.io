  <desc lang="en">Romantic comedy adapted from the bestselling novel by Helen Fielding, starring Renée Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. Weight-obsessed 30-something Bridget Jones is busy lamenting her lack of a good man when two come along at once: her flirtatious boss Daniel Cleaver and uptight childhood friend Mark Darcy. Unfortunately, in typical world-of-Bridget style, the two men have met before, and she finds herself thrust from being a wallflower to the centre of a bizarre love triangle
